# Hi
My name is Anton Vronskii.
I am an engineer with extensive product management experience.
Traditional résumé ([pdf](https://sharrp.github.io/portfolio/resume-anton-vronskii.pdf), [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/anton-vronskii)) doesn't do the best job to represent who I am, what I can and what I like to do the most. The collection of my favorite fun little projects in this portfolio augments the résumé to mitigate that.
